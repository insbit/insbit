Cool

Waiting for discord.js v13   
figure out how tf to get a database working  
find where to host the bot  
obviously learn js better  

The bot only has a basic command handler (using slash commands) at the moment. None of the commands have any real function yet.

Note to self: .. I mustve wrote some of the code somewhere else but im not sure where...
### Running
`npm i`  
`npm run start`
